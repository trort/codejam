# Codejam code archive

This is an archive of my code in the Google [codejam](https://codejam.withgoogle.com/codejam/) contests. Due to the time limit in the contests, the codes are not polished. But all code *should* be correct, though some algorithms can still be improved.

The code files here include both the ones I submitted during the contests, and the ones I used to practice before the contests. I was using `C++` from 2011 to 2015, and switched to `python` since 2016. But the distributed codejam still does not support `python`.

-------------------

Here is a list of the results I have got in each year's contests (✓ indicates advance to the next round). Trying to advance to round 3!
